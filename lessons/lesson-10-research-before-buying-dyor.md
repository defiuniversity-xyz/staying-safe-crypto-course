**Core concept:** "DYOR" (Do Your Own Research) means independently verifying claims about crypto projects before investing—don't rely on others' opinions or hype.

## Reading Reviews Before Buying

Before buying anything significant, you probably:
- Read reviews from multiple sources
- Check for common complaints
- Look at the company's reputation
- Compare alternatives
- Verify claims sound reasonable

DYOR is the same approach for crypto:
- Research from multiple sources
- Look for red flags and concerns
- Check the team and project history
- Compare to similar projects
- Verify the fundamentals make sense

The difference: crypto is newer, less regulated, and has more scams. Research is even more important.

## What to Research

### The Team
- Who's building this? Are they real people?
- Do they have relevant experience?
- Are they doxxed (publicly identified)?
- Have they built other successful projects?
- Are their claims verifiable (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)?

### The Product
- What does this project actually do?
- Does the use case make sense?
- Is there a working product, or just promises?
- How does it compare to alternatives?
- Is the technology sound?

### The Token Economics
- What is the token used for?
- How is it distributed? (Team/investors/public)
- What's the supply schedule?
- Is there meaningful utility, or just speculation?
- Are there lock-ups for team tokens?

### The Community
- Is there genuine community interest?
- Or is activity mostly bots and paid shills?
- What do skeptics say?
- Are critical questions welcomed or banned?

## Red Flags to Watch For

**Anonymous or unverifiable team:**
Real builders usually have public identities. Anonymity enables exit scams.

**Promises of guaranteed returns:**
Nothing in investing is guaranteed. Anyone promising otherwise is lying.

**No working product:**
"Coming soon" has stretched into "never" for many projects.

**Excessive hype, minimal substance:**
Marketing-heavy, product-light is a warning sign.

**Aggressive community:**
Communities that attack all criticism are often covering something up.

**Celebrity endorsements:**
Paid promotions aren't endorsements of quality.

**"Buy now or miss out!":**
Urgency tactics usually indicate something to hide.

## Research Sources

**Primary sources (best):**
- Project documentation (whitepaper, docs)
- GitHub repository
- On-chain data
- Team's direct communications

**Secondary sources (helpful):**
- Independent analysis from respected researchers
- Audit reports
- News from reputable crypto media
- Discussion in neutral forums

**Suspect sources (be careful):**
- Paid influencer content
- Project's own marketing materials
- Price predictions
- Anonymous tips

## The DYOR Process

**Step 1: Understand what it does**
Can you explain the project in simple terms? If not, understand it better before investing.

**Step 2: Verify the team**
Are these real people with relevant backgrounds?

**Step 3: Check the competition**
Is this the best project in its category? Why or why not?

**Step 4: Read the critics**
Specifically look for bearish analysis. What are the risks?

**Step 5: Evaluate the token**
Does the token make sense? Is holding it necessary to benefit from the project?

**Step 6: Assess your conviction**
After research, do you believe in this? Can you hold through a 50% drop?
