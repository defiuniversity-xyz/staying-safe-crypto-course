# Fake Support Scams
![Header](https://storage.googleapis.com/staying-safe-crypto-media/images/lesson_04/staying-safe-crypto_04_header.png)


**Core concept:** Scammers impersonate customer support from exchanges, wallet providers, and projects to trick you into revealing credentials or approving malicious transactions.

## The Imposter Tech Support Call

You've probably heard of this scam: phone rings, "This is Microsoft. We've detected a virus on your computer. Let me help you fix it." They're not from Microsoft—they want remote access to steal from you.

Crypto has the same scam, updated for the digital age:

"Hi! I'm from MetaMask support. I see you're having trouble. Let me help you verify your wallet."

They're not from MetaMask. They want your seed phrase or wallet access.

## How Fake Support Scams Work

**Step 1: Find a Target**
Scammers monitor:
- Project Discord servers for users asking questions
- Twitter/X for people complaining about issues
- Telegram groups for confused newcomers
- Comment sections of crypto content

**Step 2: Make Contact**
They reach out via:
- Direct message pretending to be support
- Reply pretending to be the official account
- Fake support ticket systems
- Sometimes even fake phone numbers

**Step 3: Gain Trust**
They use:
- Official-looking profile pictures and names
- Professional language
- Links to fake but convincing support sites
- Knowledge about common issues (making them seem legitimate)

**Step 4: Extract Value**
They ask for:
- Seed phrase "to verify your wallet"
- Screen share access
- Approval of a "security transaction"
- Remote desktop access

Then they steal everything.

## Red Flags of Fake Support

**They contacted you first:** Real support responds to your tickets—they don't DM you randomly.

**They want your seed phrase:** No legitimate support EVER needs your seed phrase. Period.

**Urgency:** "Act now or your funds will be locked!" Legitimate support doesn't threaten.

**Unusual contact methods:** Real support uses official channels, not random DMs.

**Requests for remote access:** No legitimate crypto company needs to control your computer.

**Asking you to approve transactions:** Support doesn't require you to sign or approve anything to help you.

## How Real Support Works

**Real customer support:**
- Responds through official ticket systems
- Never asks for seed phrase or private keys
- Never DMs you first on social media
- Uses official support emails (from real domains)
- Helps without requiring you to approve transactions
- Takes time to verify your identity through proper channels

**You initiate contact:**
- Go to the official website
- Find the support section
- Submit a ticket or use official chat
- Wait for response through that system

If someone contacts you about crypto support that you didn't request, it's almost certainly a scam.

## Common Fake Support Scenarios

**"Wallet compromised" DM:**
"We've detected unauthorized access to your wallet. Verify your seed phrase immediately to secure funds." → Scam.

**"Failed transaction" help:**
"I see your transaction failed. Send me the transaction details and seed phrase to help." → Scam.

**"Verification required" email:**
"Your exchange account requires re-verification. Click here and enter your credentials." → Phishing scam.

**"Airdrop claim" assistance:**
"You have unclaimed tokens! I'll help you claim them. First, approve this transaction." → Drainer scam.

**Discord "admin" DM:**
"Hi, I'm an admin. I noticed your issue. Let me help via DM." → Real admins help in public channels.

## Protection Strategies

**Never share seed phrase:** This rule has no exceptions. Ever.

**Verify support channels:** Only use support links from official websites.

**Be suspicious of DMs:** Legitimate support doesn't hunt for customers in DMs.

**Check account details:** Verify usernames carefully. Scammers use similar names with subtle differences.

**Ask publicly first:** If you're unsure, ask in the public channel if this person is real.

**Take your time:** Scammers create urgency. Real support doesn't pressure you.
