# Social Media Red Flags
![Header](https://storage.googleapis.com/staying-safe-crypto-media/images/lesson_07/staying-safe-crypto_07_header.png)


**Core concept:** Social media is where most crypto scams begin—learning to recognize warning signs can save you from expensive mistakes.

---

## Stranger Danger, Online Edition

As a kid, you learned "stranger danger"—be careful with people you don't know offering things.

Social media crypto scams follow the same pattern:
- Strangers offering help you didn't ask for
- Too-good-to-be-true opportunities
- Pressure to act quickly
- Requests for private information

The context is different, but the principles are identical.

## Platform-Specific Scams

### Twitter/X
- Fake accounts impersonating celebrities or projects
- Scam replies under legitimate crypto tweets
- Fake "support" accounts responding to complaints
- Giveaway scams in tweet threads

### Discord
- DMs from "admins" (real admins rarely DM first)
- Fake announcement channels with phishing links
- Friend requests from bot accounts
- Compromised servers posting scam links

### Telegram
- Fake groups impersonating real projects
- Unsolicited DMs about "investment opportunities"
- Pump-and-dump coordination groups
- Impersonator accounts of project leaders

### YouTube
- Fake livestreams with celebrity deepfakes
- Comments linking to scam sites
- "Leaked" crypto strategies videos
- Paid promotions for scam projects

## Universal Red Flags

**Unsolicited contact:**
You didn't ask for help, but someone's offering. Why? What do they gain?

**Urgency:**
"Act NOW! Only 10 spots left!" Legitimate opportunities don't require split-second decisions.

**Guaranteed returns:**
"100% safe, guaranteed 10x." Nothing in crypto is guaranteed.

**Asking for money first:**
"Send ETH to receive tokens." Legitimate airdrops don't require payment.

**DMs about finance:**
Legitimate projects don't recruit investors via random DMs.

**Too good to be true:**
If your gut says "this seems too good," trust your gut.

## Verification Strategies

**Check account age and history:**
- Brand new account? Red flag.
- Bought followers? (High follower count, low engagement)
- Sudden pivot to crypto? Possibly compromised account.

**Verify through official channels:**
- Is this really the official account?
- Check the project's official website for social links.
- Look for verification badges (though these can be faked too).

**Cross-reference information:**
- Can you verify this news/opportunity elsewhere?
- Are other reputable sources talking about it?

**Ask in public:**
- Before engaging with a DM, ask in the public channel: "Is this person legitimate?"
- Real community members will often confirm or deny.

## Safe Social Media Practices

**Turn off DMs from strangers:**
If possible, disable DMs from people you don't follow or aren't in servers with.

**Never click links in DMs:**
Navigate to sites directly through bookmarks or careful typing.

**Verify before engaging:**
Before clicking any link, verify the source through other channels.

**Don't share holdings:**
Broadcasting how much crypto you own makes you a target.

**Report scams:**
Report scam accounts to help protect others.

**Be skeptical by default:**
Approach crypto social media with healthy skepticism.
