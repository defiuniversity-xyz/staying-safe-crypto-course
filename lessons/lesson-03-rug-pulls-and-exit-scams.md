# Rug Pulls and Exit Scams

![Header](https://storage.googleapis.com/staying-safe-crypto-media/images/lesson_03/staying-safe-crypto_03_header.png)


**Core concept:** A rug pull happens when project creators build hype, collect investments, then vanish with the money—like a store that takes orders, collects payments, and closes overnight.

---

## The Store That Closes Overnight

Imagine a new store opens in your town:
- Grand opening with big promises
- Great prices on pre-orders
- "Limited time! Reserve yours now!"
- People line up to pay

Then one morning: doors locked, owners gone, all the money taken. The "store" was never real—just a setup to collect money and disappear.

This is exactly what rug pulls are in crypto. Projects launch with exciting promises, collect money, then vanish.

## How Rug Pulls Work

**Step 1: Create the Project**
Scammers create a token, NFT collection, or DeFi protocol. It might have:
- Professional-looking website
- Active social media
- Whitepaper with technical jargon
- Roadmap with ambitious promises

**Step 2: Build Hype**
Marketing creates excitement:
- Paid influencer promotions
- Fake community activity
- Fabricated team credentials
- "Early investor" success stories

**Step 3: Collect Money**
People buy in:
- Token presales
- NFT mints
- Liquidity pool deposits
- Staking/yield farming deposits

**Step 4: Pull the Rug**
Creators withdraw everything:
- Drain liquidity pools
- Sell all tokens crashing the price
- Delete social media
- Disappear

Investors are left holding worthless tokens or nothing at all.

## Types of Rug Pulls

### Hard Rug Pull
Immediate exit. Liquidity removed, everyone locked out, creators vanish.

### Soft Rug Pull
Gradual exit. Team slowly sells tokens, reduces development, stops communicating, abandons project over time.

### Honeypot
You can buy but not sell. Smart contract coded so only creators can sell.

### Pump and Dump
Team buys early, hypes project, sells when price peaks from new buyers, price crashes.

## Red Flags to Watch For

**Anonymous team:** Real projects have verifiable team members. "Anonymous" team = can disappear easily.

**No audit:** Unaudited smart contracts might have backdoors or bugs.

**Locked liquidity:** Is liquidity actually locked, or can creators withdraw anytime?

**Concentrated ownership:** If creators hold most tokens, they can crash price by selling.

**Unrealistic promises:** "1000x guaranteed!" "10% daily returns!" are scam signals.

**Rushed timeline:** "Buy now or miss out!" pressures decisions without research.

**Copy-paste project:** Minimal original development, just a clone of another project.

**No real utility:** What does this token actually do? "Number go up" isn't utility.

## How to Protect Yourself

**Research the team:**
- Are team members real people with verifiable history?
- LinkedIn, Twitter, past projects?
- Doxxed (publicly identified) teams have reputational risk if they rug

**Check the contract:**
- Is it audited by reputable firms?
- Can you read basic contract functions?
- Community tools can check for common rug pull patterns

**Verify liquidity:**
- Is liquidity locked? For how long?
- What percentage of supply do creators hold?

**Start small:**
- Don't put significant money in unproven projects
- Be skeptical of new launches

**Listen to your gut:**
- If something feels off, it probably is
- Hype isn't a substitute for fundamentals

## Key Takeaways

- **Rug pulls are planned exit scams**—creators build hype, collect money, disappear
- **Anonymous teams are higher risk**—they can vanish without consequences
- **Verify liquidity locks and audits**—these provide some protection (but aren't guarantees)
- **Unrealistic promises are red flags**—"guaranteed returns" don't exist
- **New projects are inherently risky**—assume you might lose everything
- **FOMO causes losses**—rushing into new projects without research is dangerous
