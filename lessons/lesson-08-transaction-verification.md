# Transaction Verification

**Core concept:** Before approving any transaction, verify what you're actually signing—scammers exploit users who click "confirm" without reading.

## Double-Checking the Shipping Address

Before mailing a package, you verify:
- Is this the right address?
- Is the contents description accurate?
- Is the shipping cost correct?

Before approving a crypto transaction, same verification:
- Is this the right recipient/contract?
- Is the action what I intended?
- Are the fees reasonable?

Clicking "approve" without checking is like mailing a package without looking at the label.

## What You're Actually Approving

When your wallet pops up asking to approve a transaction, you might be approving:

**Token transfer:** Sending tokens from your wallet.

**Token approval:** Giving a contract permission to move your tokens (dangerous if unlimited).

**Contract interaction:** Calling a function on a smart contract (could do anything the contract is programmed to do).

**Signature:** Signing a message (sometimes used for authentication, sometimes exploited).

Each type carries different risks. Understanding what type of transaction you're approving is crucial.

## Reading Wallet Prompts

When a transaction appears, check:

**What site triggered this?**
Your wallet shows which site requested the transaction. Does it match where you think you are?

**What am I sending?**
For transfers, verify the token and amount are what you intended.

**What am I approving?**
For approvals, see what token and how much access you're granting.

**Who's receiving?**
Check the recipient address. Is it what you expected?

**What function is being called?**
Some wallets show the function name. "Transfer" is different from "Approve" or "setApprovalForAll."

## Dangerous Transaction Types

**Unlimited token approvals:**
"Approve USDC spending: unlimited"
This gives the contract permission to take any amount of that token, anytime. Only approve what's needed.

**setApprovalForAll:**
For NFTs, this gives complete access to an entire collection. Very dangerous for unknown contracts.

**Blind signing:**
Some transactions can't be fully decoded. Approving something you can't read is risky.

**Multiple transactions in sequence:**
Scams sometimes request multiple approvals quickly. Each deserves individual verification.

## Before Clicking Approve

Quick checklist:

**☐ Is this site legitimate?**
Check URL in your wallet's prompt.

**☐ Is the action what I intended?**
If you expected a swap, is this a swap? If you expected to mint, is this a mint?

**☐ Is the amount correct?**
Verify token amounts match your intention.

**☐ Is the recipient expected?**
For transfers, is this address what you intended?

**☐ Is the approval limited?**
For token approvals, is it limited to the amount needed?

**☐ Do I understand what this does?**
If you don't understand, don't approve until you do.

## What to Do If Unsure

**Reject and research:**
You can always reject and come back. Transactions can be re-requested.

**Ask in public:**
For new protocols, ask in official community channels if transactions look normal.

**Use simulation tools:**
Some tools simulate transactions before execution, showing you what will happen.

**Small test first:**
For new interactions, test with small amounts first.

**When in doubt, don't approve:**
Better to miss an opportunity than lose everything to a scam.
