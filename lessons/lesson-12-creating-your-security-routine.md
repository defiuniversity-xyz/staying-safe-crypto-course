# Creating Your Security Routine
![Header](https://storage.googleapis.com/staying-safe-crypto-media/images/lesson_12/staying-safe-crypto_12_header.png)


**Core concept:** Security isn't a one-time setup—it's ongoing habits that become second nature, like locking your doors before bed.

---

## Locking Doors Before Bed

Every night, you probably:
- Lock the front door
- Close windows
- Maybe check the stove
- Set the alarm (if you have one)

You don't think about it much—it's routine. You'd feel uncomfortable NOT doing it.

Crypto security should become the same: automatic habits that protect you without requiring conscious effort every time.

---

## Daily Habits

**Before any transaction:**
- Verify you're on the correct site (check URL)
- Read what you're approving in your wallet
- Double-check addresses and amounts
- If unsure, stop and verify

**When checking crypto accounts:**
- Access through bookmarks, not search
- Verify site before entering credentials
- Be suspicious of unexpected prompts

**On social media:**
- Ignore unsolicited DMs about crypto
- Don't click links in messages
- Verify giveaway claims through official channels (hint: they're scams)

## Weekly Habits

**Review active wallet connections:**
Many wallets let you see what sites are connected. Disconnect anything you're no longer actively using.

**Check for unusual activity:**
Glance at recent transactions. Anything you don't recognize?

**Stay informed:**
Brief check of security news. Any new scams to be aware of?

---

## Monthly Habits

**Review token approvals:**
Use tools like revoke.cash to see what contracts can access your tokens. Revoke approvals you no longer need.

**Verify backup integrity:**
Are your seed phrase backups still where they should be? Still readable?

**Update software:**
Wallet apps, browser extensions, devices. Updates often include security patches.

**Review exchange security:**
2FA still enabled? Recovery options still accurate? No unauthorized devices?

---

## Periodic Security Audit

Every few months, do a deeper review:

**Wallet hygiene:**
- Still using strong, unique passwords?
- 2FA enabled everywhere possible?
- Email security solid?

**Backup verification:**
- Test that backup can actually restore (with small amounts or separate test wallet)
- Backups in multiple locations?

**Holdings review:**
- Is distribution across wallets appropriate?
- Should more be in cold storage?

**Knowledge update:**
- Any new security best practices?
- New scam types to be aware of?

---

## Building the Habit

**Start small:**
Don't try to implement everything at once. Pick 2-3 habits, make them automatic, then add more.

**Use checklists:**
Until habits are automatic, use written checklists. Check off items every time.

**Create triggers:**
Attach security checks to existing routines. "Before sending any transaction, I always verify the URL."

**Forgive mistakes:**
You'll slip up. Learn and adjust, don't quit.

**Celebrate success:**
Months of good security hygiene means avoided disasters. That's worth acknowledging.

## The Goal: Unconscious Competence

Skill development follows stages:

1. **Unconscious incompetence:** You don't know what you don't know
2. **Conscious incompetence:** You know you need to learn
3. **Conscious competence:** You can do it, but it requires attention
4. **Unconscious competence:** It's automatic

This course took you from stage 1 to stage 3. Practice turns stage 3 into stage 4—where security is just how you operate, not something you think about.
